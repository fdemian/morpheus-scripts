 Build (*build.py*): 
 ===============
 
 Build the application. 
 
 This script assumes that you have already built the frontend application (*morpheus-frontend*). In order to build the application you must:
 
  1) Specify the location of the source folders (both API and frontend) in the following lines


      # Input folders
      api_folder = "/path/to/backend/morpheus-api"
      frontend_folder = "/path/to/frontend/morpheus-frontend"

  2) Specify the destination folder.


      # Destination folder
      dest_folder = "/path/to/destination/<build folder name>"
 
  3) Run the build script

  
      python3 build.py
